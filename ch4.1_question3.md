We are given the recurrence relation:

$$
a_n = 2 \cdot a_{n-1}
$$

with the initial term:

$$
a_0 = 8
$$

To find \( a_6 \), we recognize that the sequence multiplies by 2 at each step. So the general formula becomes:

$$
a_n = a_0 \cdot 2^n
$$

Thus,

$$
a_6 = 8 \cdot 2^6 = 8 \cdot 64 = 512
$$

So, the value of \( a_6 \) is **512**.
