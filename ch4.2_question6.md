### Chapter 4.2 Question 6

**Problem:**  
Your summer job pays you $1000 per week, with a raise of $50 per week as a bonus for not being a quitter. How much will you make in the 10th week?

This is an **arithmetic sequence** because you are receiving a constant raise ($50 per week). So we can represent the amount earned in the nth week with the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot 50
$$

Where:  
- $a_n$ is the amount made in the $n$th week  
- $a_1 = 1000$ (first weekâ€™s pay)  
- $d = 50$ (weekly raise)

**Examples:**

- 1st Week: $1000  
- 2nd Week: $1050  
- 3rd Week: $1100  
- ...  
- 10th Week:

$$
a_{10} = 1000 + (10 - 1) \cdot 50 = 1000 + 450 = 1450
$$

### Final Answer:
You will make **$1450** in the **10th week**.
