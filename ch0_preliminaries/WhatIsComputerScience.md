# Notes

## Summary
This blog is meant to discuss our perspective on the field of computer science.
He starts off by mentioning how he viewed Computer Science as a science while he
was earning his bachelors in Computer Science. Then later on while he was
pursuing his PHD his opinions changed. He looked towards other sciences such as
physics and saw just how different they were to computer science. There are also not as many experiments in computer science as in other scientific fields. There used to be a lot of experiments done on computers about the efficiency of code but this has since stopped because it did not scale with the new amount of computers. This did lead to big O notation that relates to speed and memory of code. This lead to the change from real world experiments to studying more theoretical concepts in computing. Steven Wartik actually ended up saying that computer science was more akin to philosophy than science. He talks about ancient Greek philosophy and the overlap between philosophy and mathematics. He makes the comparison between computer science and philosophy because like philosophy, there isn't usually one right answer in computer science. 


## Why did we read it?
We read this article because it gives us a new way of looking at the field of computer science. Now that we are doing discrete math instead of Object Oriented Programming it is important for us to understand why we are doing the class and why its listed as a computer science class. The blog helps us find that connection between discrete math and computer science through logic. Computer science is not strictly a scientific field or mathematic field or engineering field but a logical field.


## About John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan 
John Hopcroft was a computer science professor at Cornell. He won an award called the Turing Award and has authored a lot books on computer science. 

Robert Trajan is a computer science professor at Princeton University. He made a lot of different famous algorithms and won the Turing Award.
