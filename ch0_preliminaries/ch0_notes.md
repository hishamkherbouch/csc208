# Chapter 0 Notes

Discrete math is a different type of math. It's not like algebra or geometry
it's more logic based. Problems are more complex than arithmetic like 1+1 its
more thinking based. 

The four main topics are:
1. Combinatorics
2. Sequences
3. Symbolic logic
4. Graph Theory

Discrete structures are the objects used to represent problems we are solving.
The examples listed are sets, functions, sequences, relations and graphs.

Sets are just some collection of elements, they do not have to be ordered.

Functions are some rule that includes an input that is then assigned exactly one
output. 

Sequences are similar to sets but they differ in the fact that sequences must be
ordered. 

Relations are comparisons between numbers an example being > or <.

Graphs are visual representations of se
